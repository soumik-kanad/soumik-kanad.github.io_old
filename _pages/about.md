### hello world,

I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/), [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). I'm working with [Prof. Abhinav Shrivastava](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abhinav/). I completed my undergrad from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Before joinging my PhD, I was a Research Engineer in the Medical Imaging Research Group at Healthcare & Medical Equipment division of [Samsung Research Institute - Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b). 





### research 
My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially Generative Models. I'm currently working on generative model representations, generation in implicit neural representation (INR) space and facial video generation. I have previously worked in visual forgery detection and privacy apart form various medical image analysis algorithms (ultrasound).

I am thankful for having research opportunities to work with
